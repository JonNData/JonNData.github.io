As a data scientist and engineer on a team, I helped launch a website that allows the user to interact with car data in meaningful ways. 

On the data science side we all wear the engineering and analyst hats, but my particular strengths have been the implementation of ideas.   
My XGBoost predictive model had the best scores of the team  
My function solved the complex merge between EPA and craigslist datasets  

I monitor the billing charges and keep the team notified when we are projected over budget by setting up a CloudWatch alarm
 
 
I independently test our apps to troubleshoot any issues we couldn’t solve together and ensure I sufficiently understand what we did. Here is a repository that I made
 
My  data preprocessing steps transformed the data in the most valuable way  
Since I am taking a AWS course concurrently, I think my familiarity with AWS has been a good asset. I’ve tracked EC2 instances alongside our elastic beanstalk creations, as well as kept the S3 buckets in mind  
 
I co-wrote the code to fetch car_images and return working links, then I refactored it heavily to be more programmatic and easier to read.  
 
I guided general command line use with virtual environments and git usage  
 
What are some of your weaknesses as a member of your team? How have you worked to overcome some of your individual weaknesses? Be specific.  

Object oriented programming mindset  

Following mikio’s example I implemented it in the rest of our functions and app  
Pytest  
Researched and watched videos to learn  
Describe a teamwork problem that you as a team have had to overcome. How did you contribute to the problem itself? How did you contribute to the solution to the problem? Be specific.  
Total group involvement. Some members need encouragement to speak out  
At times, to move things along I just cut to the point. There may or may not be instances in which a longer silence would produce input from others  
Sometimes I’ll ask for input from people that haven’t spoken up  
How is your team measuring the success of your product? How do you know you are solving user problems? How are you using these measurements to inform what to build next?  
As a team we measure our success by the continued bewilderment of management in response to our progression speed.  
 
 
 
In terms of users, we have measured the time it takes to do car comparison tasks on the major car websites  
I have distributed the site for review and submitted responses
