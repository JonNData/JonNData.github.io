I made an [app](https://used-car-predictor.herokuapp.com/) that takes data scraped from craigslist and utilizes a random forest model to generate price predictions!

I deployed an app via plotly dash onto heroku to expose the prediction model endpoint.

See insights and process pages for an overview of the project.  
Things I cover:  
*  Model selection and evaluation metrics.
* An important lesson in practical data science
* Insights on the dataset scraped from Craigslist
* How to interpret a random forest Shapley Values
* A choropleth

Plus the app is fun to play with!
