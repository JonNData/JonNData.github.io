As a small part of my labs project, I am doing some analysis on U.S. gas prices. Here is my current tableau graph!

[Tableau link](https://public.tableau.com/views/USGasprices/Dashboard1?:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)
<center><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/USGasprices/Dashboard1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" width="1200" height="727" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>

Note: embedding tableau was quite finnicky, the parameters ":showVizHome=no&:embed=true" was needed at the end.
